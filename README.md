## Instagram Firestore

The idea about this project is cloning Instagram to iOS apps using Swift 5 following Stephan Dowless course at Udemy to learn more about Swift and iOS development

#### This app will (this is literally a instagram clone without the chat part)
- Register new user
- Login to the app
- show the posts feed (With post user, post image, likes and comments)
- Search for users
- Follow and unfollow profiles
- Show profiles
- Edit profile


While I advance thru the app development this readme will start to have some prints.

That's it :relieved:
